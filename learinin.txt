create-react-app . means i want to make the react app inside of the client folder

to connect socket.io to the frontend we use a library named socket.io-client

input is not taken when enter key is press but manually clicking the button does then
  onKeyDown={(e)=>{e.key==="Enter"&&your_function()}}


  use import ScrollToBottom from 'react-scroll-to-bottom' to scroll the content always to bottom automatically

  to automatically clear the input filled after writing make the input tags value empty after send function is done
